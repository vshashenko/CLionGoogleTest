- Tree icons for suites
- Improve icons
- Handle xml parsing errors.
- Proper handling of unexpected output from test discovery command.
- Add progress indication while executing tests (based on prev. execution times?)
- Handle crashed gtest process. Mark crashed test as failed in the test tree.
- Problem: dicover tests, run selected test-suite, add another test to the suite, run selected again -- no new tests. So a discover before run is still better.
- If the gtest process chashes, write this to the run summary.
- Two run buttons: Run all, Run dropdown (selected, failed, not run)
- Execution times in right-aligned column of the tree control
- No horizontal scroll bar
- Go to the test source code on a tree item double click: implement without calling grep, support not only *.cpp.
- While using grep for the goto operation, use wait cursor.
- Handle if the process crashes or is not a gtest exe or not found ("No output from the gtest executable. Probably it crashed or is incorrect.".)
- Stand-alone app in release
- Problem if "Build all" selected (or no active config selected).
- Dropdown list to select gtest target
- Autodetect target with gtest
- Debug selected tests (runs with clion debugger command)
- Kill running gtest process on app/Clion exit.
- Filter window for the test tree
- Context menu for test tree items
- Try how the test window looks in the dark theme
- Save discovered tests between restart?
- Add warnings to the result of a test and total number of warnings to the summary.
  Warnings are not in xml file, only in the console output.
  An example:
[ RUN      ] StreamingTest.onStreamingHeartbeatReceivedInTime

GMOCK WARNING:
